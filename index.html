								<h4>Who am I?</h4>
								<p> 
									I'm a hardworking Kiwi who has moved to London to broaden my horizons and see a new part of the world. I always enjoyed problem-solving growing up and this naturally led me to programming and put me on the path to becoming a Software Engineer. Along with my strong technical abilities, one of my most significant assets is my soft skills. In my professional experience as a Game Programmer, this allowed me to effectively communicate with other developers along with other disciplines such as artists, QA, producers, etc.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have always been highly adaptable, flexible and efficient when it comes to my work. Something I proved right out of university. My professional career started as an intern at <a href="https://cerebralfix.com/"> Cerebralfix </a>, where I thrived and quickly proved myself as a critical asset, gaining full employment immediately after the end of the internship. For a full run down of my time at Cerebralfix see <a href="#work">here</a>.
								</p>
								<h4>UK right to work</h4>
								<p>
									I currently hold a Youth Mobility Visa which gives me full rights to work until June 2025 with the ability to extend this further!

								<h2 class="major">Skills</h2>
								<h3>Experiences with Development Languages</h3>
								<p>Through my four year Software Engineering degree, multiple internships working in the scientific domain and my four and a half years working in game development. I have great experience with the following languages.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/work/languages.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Experiences with Version Control Systems</h3>
								<p>
									Version control has been an essential tool in my professional journey. Using platforms like Git and Perforce has enabled seamless collaboration, systematic development, and the ability to track changes, resolve conflicts, and roll back to previous versions.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/work/version-control.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Scrum and Agile Processes</h3>
								<p>
									A core aspect of my Software Engineering degree was covering and understanding the full scope of the software development cycle. Which I put into practice in a professional capacity in my previous role. As well as taking part in Agile development, as a technical lead on many projects, I actively managed this process. Working with production team members to aid in the roadmapping of projects. In terms of software, most of my experience comes with working with and managing Trello and Jira boards.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/work/management.png" alt="" /></span>								
								<p>
									Using this software I also was an active participant in the scoping of work as well as scoping entire projects as a part of the bid team.

							<article id="pro-exp">
								<h2 class="major">Professional Experience</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cfix/cerebralfix.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									I spent 4 and a half years working at <a href="https://cerebralfix.com/"> Cerebralfix </a>, a game studio doing work-for-hire before moving to the United Kingdom in June 2023. During my time at the studio, I worked mainly in the Interactive Experience space. At first, this was creating Web-based experiences using Phaser and Typescript, however, this quickly pivoted to Unreal Engine development of larger 3D experiences using C++.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cfix/tools.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									My role at Cerebralfix expanded to being a Techincal Lead on various projects, this involved some of the following responsibilities:
									<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
										<li>Scoping incoming projects.</li>
										<li>Tracking milestones and adjusting the roadmap as requirements changed.</li>
										<li>Working with external developers and liaising with high-profile clients, such as Disney Parks.</li>
										<li>Ensuring communication was high in the team and that everyone had clear goals and direction.</li>
									  </ul>
								</p>	
								<p>
									Unfortunately, large amounts of my work was under NDA so myself and Cerebralfix are unable to explicitly reference them. However, some of the projects I worked on that I can mention are …
								</p>
								<h3>Whale Watch Kaikōura Onboard Experience</h3>
								<p>
									This was my final project at CerebralFix and was another example of a successfully delivered project where I acted as Techincal Lead.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cfix/wwk.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Some of the main technical challenges overcome during the development of this experience were:
									<ul style="padding-left: 30px">
										<li>Profiling and Optimising a third-party ocean plugin.</li>
										<li>Investigating and Implementing Unreal Engine pixel streaming.</li>
										<li>Creating a GeoTIFF parser plugin to turn the local terrain data into a Unreal Landscape mesh.</li>
										<li>Creating a plugin to accept GPS data provided by a custom API, providing the ability to accurately place the vessel in the 3D level.</li>
										<li>Custom scripting to enable deploying new builds and content versions remotely to the vessels.
										</li>
									  </ul>
								</p>

								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cfix/wwk-2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Adversity and Co (Virtual Production)</h3>
								<p>
									This was one of the major R&D efforts I was a part of at CerebralFix. When EPIC first released the Virtual Production tools under early access, it was decided that we would try and get a prototype working inside Unreal Engine. This was a real challenge as there was very little complete documentation and the functionality was not set up in Blueprints and templates the way it is today.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cfix/virtual-production.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Nonetheless, we were able to get a working prototype in December 2021. Which was then further refined and used to create two short films, one of which won ‘Best VFX’ at the Poppy Jasper Film Festival in 2023.
								</p>
								<p>

								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/intro-pic.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Rugby Runner</h3>
								<p>
									This was a very small 1-month project where I was a solo dev working with a part-time tester and artist. The scope of this game was a simple endless runner for a short marketing campaign. It followed OO design principle and had a basic CI pipeline for development. It was developed in Typescript using the HTML game engine <a href="https://phaser.io/"> Phaser </a>. The reason it was developed in Phaser was because the game was predominantly a game for their website and Phaser works off a Canvas object which can be easily positioned on a web page.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cfix/rugby-runner.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									We then used a tool called Cordova which hosted the web page and meant we could launch the game on the app stores.
								</p>
								<h3>Summer Internship Program</h3>
								<p>
									In 2022, I took on the responsibility to refresh and manage the internship program, giving a new set of students the opportunity to gain first-hand experience in the industry. This involved 4 developers and 1 artist working on a series of R&D-based projects in both Unreal Engine and Unity. These projects were run in the same way all projects at Cerebralfix were run giving the students the best insight into the industry as possible.
